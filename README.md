# OpenGL Graphics ( Procedural Generated City 3D )
I developed a procedural generated 3D city using C++ and OpenGL that has a different structure on each different run of the program. The purpose of this project was to stimulate creativity and to deepen knowledge such as 3D models, geometric transformations, illumination and texture mapping.
